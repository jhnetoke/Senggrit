## lazyScripts
Honestly I am really lazy and sick of having to type things for installing certain projects. 
Some of you may have the same idea, so here you go!

**Make sure you chmod +x [file] so that they can actually run correctly**

**_Also if your machine breaks because of these I am not taking any blame for it._**

!!!This code is distributed as is and if you don't trust it, don't use it!!!

What each script does:

#### gitLabPiInstall.sh:
This script will install gitLab onto your RaspberryPi. Have your own git repository at home if you want to keep things private!

#### elkStack.sh
This script will install elkStack for your linux machine. Although it won't configure it for you... just install it.
